# Serene Frontend (Angular)

This is the **frontend** of the Serene StarterKit — a modern and minimalist setup built with **Angular 20** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Serene backend (Spring Boot) using **JWT tokens stored in HttpOnly cookies** for secure authentication.

Inspired by the simplicity of Laravel Breeze, this project provides a solid foundation for building secure, fast, and clean web apps from day one.
